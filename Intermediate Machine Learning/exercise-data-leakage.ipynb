(비슷한 데이터가 예측에 사용되서는 안됨)\n- 이러한 문제는 training set 에 대해서는 high performance를 불러와도, 모델은 perform poorly in production\n\n- There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination. \n\n#### 1) Target Leakage\n    - 예측시 사용할 수 없는 데이터가 예측 변수에 포함된 경우 발생\n    - 데이터를 이용하는 시기 또는 시간 순으로 feature가 좋은 prediction에 도움이 되는지 안되는지를 고려하는 것이 매우 중요함![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n    - 예제에서는 pneumonia를 걸리고 나서 항생제를 먹으므로 took_antibiotic_medicine 변수는 옳지 않음!!\n    - validation data도 training data에서 holdout 시킨 동일한 source이므로, 좋은 validation은 될 것이지만, \n    - 실생활에 적용한다면 매우 부적절하다!!\n    - 폐렴에 걸릴 환자도 추후 예측이 필요할 때 아직 항생제를 투여하지 않았기 때문\n    - 따라서, target attribute가 실제로 발생한 뒤에 업데이트(생성)된 변수는 제외시킬 것!!!!\n#### 2) Train-Test contamination\n    - validation data로부터 training data를 구별하지 못할 때 주의하지 않으면 leak 발생\n    - 실제로는 validation은 모델이 전에 존재하지 않았던 데이터에 대해 측정하는 것을 의미하는데, \n    - validation data가 전처리에 영향을 받는지 안 받는지에 따라 이러한 과정에 방해 될 수 있음\n    \n    - 예를 들어, train test split 하기 전에, 전처리로 결측치 대체해버리면 모델은 valid data도 좋은 data가 되어 성능은 좋치만 배포 시, 안 좋을 수 있음\n    - 이러한 문제는 더 복잡한 feature enginnering 할 때 더 위험함\n    - validation이 간단히 train-test split으로만 된다면, 전처리 단계의 fitting을 포함시켜 모든 유형의 fitting에서 검증 데이터를 제외한다.\n    - 이는 사이킷런의 pipeline에서 쉽게 적용 가능,또한 cross-validation 할 때 pipeline 안에 전처리를 하기에 더 critical 이 됨\n\nMost people find target leakage very tricky until they've thought about it for a long time.\n\nSo, before trying to think about leakage in the housing price example, we'll go through a few examples in other applications. Things will feel more familiar once you come back to a question about house prices.\n\n# Setup\n\nThe questions below will give you feedback on your answers.
